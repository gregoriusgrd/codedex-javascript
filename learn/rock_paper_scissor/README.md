# Rock Paper Scissors 👊✌️✋
This project simulates the classic Rock Paper Scissors game between a player and the computer.

## Game Rules
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
  
## Program Details
1. The player makes a selection:
- 0 for Rock
- 1 for Paper
- 2 for Scissors
2. The computer randomly generates its choice using Math.random(), selecting a value between 0 and 2.
3. The program compares the player’s choice with the computer's choice using conditionals to determine the winner.

## Example Output:
```
Player picked:      Rock
Computer picked:    Scissors
The player won!
```
The result will display whether the player won, lost, or tied with the computer, based on the choices made.
