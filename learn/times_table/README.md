# Multiplication Table Generator ðŸ§®

## How It Works
1. Define the following in index.js:
- A multiple variable (an integer greater than 0).
- A numbers array containing integers from 0 to 9.

2. Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers array and multiply each number by the multiple.

## Example Output:
```
9 x 0 = 0
9 x 1 = 9
9 x 2 = 18
9 x 3 = 27
9 x 4 = 36
9 x 5 = 45
9 x 6 = 54
9 x 7 = 63
9 x 8 = 72
9 x 9 = 81
```
