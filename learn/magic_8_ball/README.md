# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±
This project simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball for fortune-telling and advice seeking.

## How It Works
1. Possible Answers:
The program randomly selects one of the following answers:

- Yes - definitely.
- It is decidedly so.
- Without a doubt.
- Reply hazy, try again.
- Ask again later.
- Better not tell you now.
- My sources say no.
- Outlook not so good.
- Very doubtful.

2. Asking a Question:
 
- Input any Yes or No question.
- The program will generate a random response each time it's executed.

## Example Output:
```
Question:       "Will I ace my exam?"
Magic 8 Ball:   Outlook not so good.
```
